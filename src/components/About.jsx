        <p className="text-xl  mt-20 ">Hi, my name is Bhavya Khatri and I am a front-end developer with a strong passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing websites. I have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am eager to apply my skills to real-world projects.

During my studies, I completed several projects that required me to design, build, and test websites from scratch. This experience has given me a strong foundation in front-end development and has allowed me to develop my skills in a practical setting. I am also familiar with React and I am excited to continue exploring this technology to build dynamic user interfaces.</p>

      <p className="text-xl  ">As a front-end developer, my goal is to create websites that not only look great, but also provide a seamless user experience. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow, and I believe that my attention to detail, passion for technology, and drive to succeed will make me a valuable asset to any team.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends, experimenting with new technologies, and exploring my creative side through design and photography.

If you're looking for a motivated and talented front-end developer, I would be honored to discuss how I can contribute to your organization.</p>
